Multithreaded search and copy utility. 
The utility will allow searching for files in the root dir that contain a name with a given pattern and a certain extention (txt, pdf...) 
Files with a specific extension that contain this pattern in their name will be copied to a specified directory.
If the destination dir does not exist, the program will create it.
